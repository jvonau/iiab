This 6th stage is for larger Educational Apps and Learning Content, including LMS's (Learning Management Systems).

As opposed to the next stage (7-generic-apps) which is for smaller server apps that are more generic, personal or collaborative.

As in the case of 7-generic-apps, 8-mgmt-tools and 9-local-addons: this stage installs user-facing server apps.
